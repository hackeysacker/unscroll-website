# Challenge Icons Improved ✅

## Summary

All challenge and exercise icons have been updated with better, more visually distinctive emojis that better represent each activity type.

## Note About "Bonus Challenges"

The current Focus Journey system **does not have bonus challenges** - all activities are required to complete each level. The system documentation states:

> "All exercises are required (no bonus)"

If you'd like to add a bonus/optional challenge system, we would need to modify the journey-levels system to support it.
