SPLASH SCREEN IMAGE PLACEHOLDER
================================

To complete the splash screen setup, you need to add a splash.png image to this assets folder.

Recommended specs:
- File name: splash.png
- Size: 1284 x 2778 pixels (iPhone 14 Pro Max size)
- Background: Dark gradient (#030712 to #1e293b)
- Logo: Your phone with X mark logo centered
- Format: PNG with transparency

The AnimatedSplashScreen component will show your logo with a beautiful animation:
1. Outer circle fades in and scales up
2. Phone outline appears with spring animation
3. Inner circle appears inside the phone screen
4. X mark appears with rotation
5. Everything fades out and transitions to the app

The animation lasts about 2.6 seconds total.

You can create the splash.png by:
1. Taking a screenshot of the AnimatedSplashScreen at its peak (around 1.5s)
2. Using design software like Figma or Photoshop
3. Exporting the logo you showed me as a high-resolution PNG

Once you have splash.png in this folder, the expo splash config will use it
for the native splash screen, and then the AnimatedSplashScreen will take over
for the animated version.
