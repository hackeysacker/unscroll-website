# Fixed! ✅

The issue was a missing `expo-asset` package. It's now installed.

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ Installed `expo-asset` package (required by Expo)
- ✅ Dependencies are now complete

## Next Steps

The app should now start. You should see:

1. **Terminal output** showing:
   - "Starting Metro Bundler"
   - Connection URL

2. **Browser opens automatically** to:
   - `http://localhost:8081`
   - **QR code will be displayed here!**

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Try using `npx` instead:

```powershell
npx expo start
```

This ensures you're using the correct Expo version.

## Scan the QR Code

Once you see the QR code:

- **Android**: Open Expo Go → Scan QR code
- **iPhone**: Use Camera app → Scan QR code

The app will load on your phone! 🎉
